# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the integration of Spring Session with Hazelcast for distributed session management in the existing Camunda BPM Spring Boot application. The feature will enable session storage in Hazelcast for scalability, session persistence across application restarts, and support for multi-instance deployments while maintaining compatibility with Camunda's authentication and user management.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature enhances the application's scalability and reliability by:
- Enabling horizontal scaling through distributed session storage
- Providing session persistence across application restarts
- Supporting multi-instance deployment scenarios
- Maintaining security and user state consistency across the cluster

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user sessions to be stored in Hazelcast, so that the application can scale horizontally and maintain session state across multiple instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Spring Session SHALL be configured to use Hazelcast as the session store
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the session data SHALL be stored in Hazelcast with appropriate expiration settings
3. WHEN multiple application instances are running THEN all instances SHALL share the same session store
4. WHEN an application instance is restarted THEN existing user sessions SHALL remain valid and accessible from other instances

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Camunda web interface user, I want my login session to persist across application restarts, so that I don't need to re-authenticate when the system is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log into Camunda Tasklist/Cockpit/Admin THEN my session SHALL be stored in Hazelcast
2. WHEN the application server restarts THEN my session SHALL remain valid if not expired
3. WHEN I access Camunda web interfaces THEN my authentication state SHALL be preserved from the distributed session store
4. IF my session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Spring Session configuration to be externalized and tunable, so that session behavior can be customized for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN session timeout SHALL be configurable via application.yaml
2. WHEN configuring the application THEN Hazelcast session map settings SHALL be customizable (backup count, TTL, eviction)
3. IF session configuration is invalid THEN the application SHALL fail to start with a clear error message
4. WHEN in development mode THEN session settings SHALL be optimized for development workflow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want session data to be secured and properly managed, so that unauthorized access is prevented and session lifecycle is controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are stored in Hazelcast THEN session data SHALL be serialized securely
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the session SHALL be immediately invalidated in Hazelcast
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN they SHALL be automatically cleaned up from Hazelcast
4. IF session tampering is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want to monitor session storage health and performance, so that I can ensure the system is operating correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the system THEN session store connectivity SHALL be included in health checks
2. WHEN accessing management endpoints THEN session metrics SHALL be available (active sessions, session creation rate)
3. IF Hazelcast session store becomes unavailable THEN health checks SHALL reflect the failure
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN session-related logs SHALL provide sufficient information for diagnosis

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Session configuration should be separate from existing Hazelcast configuration
- **Modular Design**: Spring Session configuration should be a distinct, optional module that can be enabled/disabled
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize impact on existing Hazelcast and Camunda configurations
- **Clear Interfaces**: Provide clean separation between session management and business logic

### Performance
- Session operations (read/write) should complete within 50ms under normal load
- Session data serialization should be optimized to minimize memory usage
- Session cleanup should not impact application performance
- Support for at least 1000 concurrent sessions per application instance

### Security
- Session data must be encrypted during serialization if containing sensitive information
- Session IDs must be cryptographically secure and unpredictable
- Session fixation attacks must be prevented through proper session management
- Unauthorized session access must be prevented through proper Hazelcast security

### Reliability
- Session store must have 99.9% availability during normal operation
- Session data must be backed up according to configured Hazelcast backup settings
- Failed session operations should not cause application crashes
- Session store connection failures should be handled gracefully with appropriate fallback behavior

### Usability
- Session timeout warnings should be configurable for web interfaces
- Session management should be transparent to end users
- Administrative interfaces should provide session monitoring capabilities
- Configuration should be intuitive and well-documented
