# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing Hazelcast distributed transactions functionality that allows multiple services to safely access and manipulate shared Hazelcast objects or data. The implementation will extend the existing RestServiceDelegate to demonstrate and validate Hazelcast's distributed transaction capabilities in a real-world Camunda workflow scenario, ensuring ACID properties across multiple distributed operations.

The feature addresses the critical need for maintaining data consistency across multiple service calls within a single business transaction, particularly when coordinating operations across distributed Camunda service tasks that share common data structures in Hazelcast.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product vision by:

- **Demonstrate Enterprise Integration Patterns**: Implementing distributed transactions showcases advanced enterprise-grade Hazelcast usage patterns beyond basic caching
- **Enable Horizontal Scalability**: Distributed transactions ensure data consistency even when multiple application instances perform concurrent operations on shared data
- **Improve System Resilience**: Transaction rollback capabilities provide automatic recovery from partial failures in multi-step workflows
- **Reduce Data Inconsistency Risk**: ACID guarantees prevent race conditions and partial updates that could corrupt business-critical workflow data

The implementation serves as a reference for enterprise developers building reliable, scalable workflow applications that require strong consistency guarantees across distributed operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Service Distributed Transaction Coordination

**User Story:** As a workflow engine administrator, I want multiple Camunda service tasks to participate in a single distributed transaction, so that all operations either succeed together or fail together, maintaining data consistency across the entire business process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple service delegates access the same Hazelcast objects THEN the system SHALL coordinate their operations within a single distributed transaction context
2. IF any service delegate operation fails THEN the system SHALL automatically roll back all changes made by other service delegates in the same transaction  
3. WHEN a distributed transaction commits successfully THEN all participating service delegates SHALL have their changes persisted atomically in Hazelcast
4. IF a transaction timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL roll back all pending changes and throw a meaningful exception to the workflow engine
5. WHEN concurrent transactions access overlapping data THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions through appropriate isolation levels

### Requirement 2: RestServiceDelegate Transaction Integration  

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want RestServiceDelegate to support distributed transactions for external API calls coordinated with Hazelcast operations, so that external service state remains consistent with internal workflow data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RestServiceDelegate makes external API calls THEN the system SHALL coordinate these calls with Hazelcast operations in a single transaction
2. IF an external API call fails THEN the system SHALL roll back associated Hazelcast changes automatically
3. WHEN Hazelcast operations fail THEN the system SHALL prevent external API calls from proceeding or compensate for completed calls
4. IF network timeouts occur during API calls THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully within the transaction timeout window
5. WHEN API responses contain data THEN the system SHALL store this data in Hazelcast transactionally

### Requirement 3: Transactional Data Structure Access

**User Story:** As a service delegate developer, I want to access Hazelcast maps, queues, and other data structures through transactional interfaces, so that my operations maintain ACID properties and can be rolled back if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Hazelcast maps in a transaction THEN the system SHALL provide TransactionalMap interfaces with getForUpdate, put, and delete operations
2. IF queue operations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide TransactionalQueue interfaces with offer and poll operations  
3. WHEN reading data for modification THEN the system SHALL use getForUpdate to establish proper locking semantics
4. IF multiple data structures are accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain transactional consistency across all structures
5. WHEN transaction boundaries are crossed THEN the system SHALL properly propagate transaction context between service calls

### Requirement 4: Transaction Context Management and Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable transaction settings and proper context management, so that I can tune performance and reliability based on my specific deployment requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria  

1. WHEN configuring transactions THEN the system SHALL support both TWO_PHASE and ONE_PHASE transaction types with clear documentation of trade-offs
2. IF transaction timeouts need adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of timeout values per transaction type or globally
3. WHEN monitoring transaction health THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on transaction success rates, duration, and failure reasons
4. IF XA coordination is needed THEN the system SHALL support integration with external XA-compliant resources like databases
5. WHEN transaction context must be propagated THEN the system SHALL maintain context across service delegate calls within the same process instance

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a workflow operations engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms for distributed transactions, so that partial failures don't leave the system in inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction failures occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including transaction ID, participating services, and failure cause
2. IF deadlock situations arise THEN the system SHALL detect them and automatically retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN network partitions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and maintain data consistency when connectivity is restored  
4. IF cluster membership changes during transactions THEN the system SHALL either complete successfully or roll back cleanly
5. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable guidance for resolution

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability Validation

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the distributed transaction implementation to meet specific performance criteria, so that it can handle production workloads without degrading overall system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing simple transactions (2-3 operations) THEN the system SHALL complete within 100ms under normal conditions
2. IF complex transactions (5+ operations) are executed THEN the system SHALL complete within 500ms under normal conditions
3. WHEN handling concurrent transactions THEN the system SHALL maintain throughput of at least 100 transactions per second
4. IF memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL not consume more than 50MB additional heap space for transaction metadata
5. WHEN stress testing with 1000+ concurrent processes THEN the system SHALL maintain transaction success rate above 99%

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Transaction management components should be separated from business logic in service delegates
- **Modular Design**: Transaction utilities should be reusable across different service delegate implementations  
- **Dependency Management**: Transaction dependencies should be clearly isolated and mockable for testing
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between transaction managers, service delegates, and Hazelcast operations

### Performance

- **Transaction Latency**: 95th percentile transaction completion time must be under 200ms
- **Memory Overhead**: Transaction metadata should not exceed 1KB per active transaction
- **Resource Cleanup**: All transaction resources must be automatically cleaned up within 30 seconds of completion
- **Concurrent Transaction Limit**: Support minimum 500 concurrent active transactions without degradation

### Security  

- **Transaction Isolation**: Ensure proper isolation between concurrent transactions to prevent data leakage
- **Authentication Integration**: Transaction operations must respect existing Hazelcast security configurations
- **Audit Trail**: All transaction operations must be logged for security auditing and compliance
- **Access Control**: Verify that transaction participants have appropriate permissions for accessed data

### Reliability

- **Transaction Atomicity**: Guarantee 100% atomicity - either all operations succeed or none do
- **Consistency**: Maintain referential integrity across all transactional data structures  
- **Durability**: Changes must survive node failures once transaction is committed (within Hazelcast cluster durability limits)
- **Availability**: Transaction system must remain available during normal cluster membership changes

### Usability

- **Developer Experience**: Transaction APIs should follow Spring/Java transaction patterns familiar to enterprise developers
- **Configuration Simplicity**: Enable transactions with minimal configuration changes to existing service delegates
- **Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for common transaction failure scenarios
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive examples showing transaction usage patterns and best practices
