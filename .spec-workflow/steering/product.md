# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
This is a demonstration project that showcases the integration of Camunda BPM workflow engine with Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG). It solves the challenge of building scalable, distributed workflow applications that can handle session management and data sharing across multiple application instances.

## Target Users
- **Enterprise Developers**: Teams implementing scalable workflow solutions in production environments
- **Solution Architects**: Professionals designing distributed business process management systems
- **DevOps Engineers**: Teams responsible for deploying and maintaining scalable workflow applications
- **Learning Developers**: Individual developers exploring Camunda-Hazelcast integration patterns

## Key Features

1. **Distributed Workflow Variable Storage**: Seamlessly store and retrieve workflow variables using Hazelcast distributed maps
2. **Distributed Session Management**: Enable horizontal scaling with Spring Session backed by Hazelcast for session persistence
3. **BPMN Process Integration**: Demonstrate real-world workflow patterns with PUT/GET operations to distributed cache
4. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Production-ready configuration management for development, testing, and production environments
5. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and monitoring endpoints for operational visibility
6. **Docker-Ready Deployment**: Complete containerization with Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling

## Business Objectives
- **Demonstrate Enterprise Integration Patterns**: Provide a reference implementation for Camunda-Hazelcast integration
- **Enable Horizontal Scalability**: Show how to build workflow applications that can scale across multiple instances
- **Reduce Session Stickiness**: Eliminate the need for sticky sessions in load-balanced environments
- **Improve System Resilience**: Demonstrate session persistence across application restarts and failures

## Success Metrics
- **Session Persistence**: 100% session retention across application restarts
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Successfully run multiple application instances sharing session state
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times for workflow variable operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful handling of Hazelcast node failures

## Product Principles

1. **Scalability First**: All components designed to support horizontal scaling and distributed deployment
2. **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment-specific settings without code changes for different deployment scenarios
3. **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring, health checks, and debugging capabilities built-in
4. **Security by Default**: Secure session management with configurable security settings for different environments

## Monitoring & Visibility
- **Dashboard Type**: Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus metrics endpoint
- **Real-time Updates**: Health endpoint monitoring with /actuator/health for live status checking
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Session count, Hazelcast cluster health, workflow execution metrics, JVM performance
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Prometheus metrics export for integration with monitoring systems like Grafana

## Future Vision
This project serves as a foundation for building enterprise-grade, distributed workflow applications with robust session management and caching capabilities.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Remote Access**: Dashboard for real-time monitoring of workflow executions and Hazelcast cluster status
- **Analytics**: Historical workflow performance metrics and session usage patterns
- **Collaboration**: Multi-tenant support with isolated workflow and session contexts
- **Advanced Caching**: Smart caching strategies for workflow variables with TTL and eviction policies
