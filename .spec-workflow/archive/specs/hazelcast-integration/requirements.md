# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces Hazelcast as an In-Memory Database (IMDB) and In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) solution into the existing Camunda BPM Spring Boot application. The integration will provide basic distributed caching capabilities for general application data without requiring integration with Camunda-specific functionality.

The Hazelcast integration will be a standalone caching layer that can be tested independently and used for general application data caching needs.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the evolution of the workflow application by:
- Adding distributed caching infrastructure for future scalability
- Providing a foundation for high-performance data access patterns
- Enabling basic in-memory data grid capabilities
- Setting up infrastructure for potential future distributed computing needs

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Hazelcast Package Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Hazelcast integrated into the Spring Boot application, so that I have access to distributed caching capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Hazelcast SHALL initialize with a default embedded configuration
2. WHEN Hazelcast is enabled THEN the system SHALL create a default Hazelcast instance accessible throughout the application
3. WHEN the application configuration is loaded THEN Hazelcast SHALL be configurable through Spring Boot properties
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN Hazelcast SHALL properly cleanup and release resources

### Requirement 2: Basic Distributed Map Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Hazelcast distributed maps, so that I can store and retrieve cached data across application instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored in a Hazelcast map THEN it SHALL be accessible from the same application instance
2. WHEN data is stored in a Hazelcast map THEN it SHALL persist in memory until explicitly removed or evicted
3. WHEN the application accesses a Hazelcast map THEN it SHALL use a named map with configurable properties
4. WHEN data is added to a map THEN the system SHALL handle basic operations (put, get, remove, contains)

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want basic Hazelcast configuration options, so that I can control cache behavior and resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN Hazelcast configuration SHALL be externalized through Spring Boot properties
2. WHEN memory limits are set THEN Hazelcast maps SHALL respect configured memory limits
3. WHEN the application starts THEN Hazelcast SHALL use sensible default configurations
4. WHEN cluster configuration is needed THEN basic cluster settings SHALL be configurable

### Requirement 4: Health and Monitoring Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic monitoring capabilities for Hazelcast, so that I can verify the cache is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are performed THEN Hazelcast health SHALL be included in Spring Boot actuator endpoints
2. WHEN the application logs events THEN Hazelcast startup and shutdown SHALL be logged
3. WHEN errors occur THEN Hazelcast exceptions SHALL be properly logged with meaningful messages
4. WHEN the cache is accessed THEN basic usage information SHALL be available for monitoring

### Requirement 5: Simple Cache Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify Hazelcast caching functionality, so that I can confirm the integration is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test stores data in cache THEN it SHALL be retrievable immediately
2. WHEN a test stores data with TTL THEN it SHALL expire after the specified time
3. WHEN a test performs basic map operations THEN all operations SHALL work correctly (put, get, remove, size)
4. WHEN running unit tests THEN Hazelcast functionality SHALL be testable in isolation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Hazelcast configuration and caching services should be in separate, focused components
- **Modular Design**: Create distinct configuration and service classes for cache management
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between Hazelcast components and existing application functionality
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts for caching operations

### Performance
- Cache access latency should be under 1ms for local operations
- Memory usage should be configurable with reasonable defaults (max 256MB heap for cache)
- Startup time impact should be minimal (additional 1-2 seconds maximum)
- Basic operations should have minimal overhead

### Security
- Support for basic security configuration when needed
- Secure handling of cached data
- No exposure of sensitive information in logs

### Reliability
- Graceful degradation when cache operations fail
- Proper cleanup of cached data to prevent memory leaks
- Error handling for cache unavailability scenarios
- Stable operation without impacting existing application functionality

### Usability
- Zero-configuration startup with sensible defaults
- Clear logging and error messages for troubleshooting
- Integration with existing Spring Boot configuration patterns
- Simple API for basic cache operations
